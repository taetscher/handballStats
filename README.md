# handballStats
Just learning about web scraping - and about git in general

This repository allows you to scrape data from handball.ch.
It gets player statistics of pre-defined groups (corresponding to leagues/years).

Then, it currently calculates rudimentary statistics from that.
Like how many goals were scored per player per team per game on average.
I would like to expand on this in the future.

![Example Statistic](https://github.com/taetscher/handballStats/blob/master/output_png/U15_Elite_201920_meanGoalsPerPlayerPerTeamPerGame.png "Example Statistic")

Furthermore, the program gets statistics of each game (liveticker-stats) and plots (per stat available) multivariate time series of each team as well as time series data (progression over the season) of each player of each team.
