# handballStats

Have a look at this repo's <a href="https://taetscher.github.io/handballStats/index.html" target="blank">gh-pages page</a>!

This repository was created for me to learn about web scraping and git/github flow.
If you have any comments, ideas for improvement, let me know!

This repository allows you to scrape data from <a href="https://www.handball.ch/de/matchcenter/" target="blank">handball.ch</a>. Please be aware the scraper built in this repository is made to scrape data from games which were recorded using the <a href="https://www.handball.ch/de/matchcenter/liveticker/" target="blank">liveticker</a> feature. Other games cannot be analyzed with it currently.

At this point, only the performance-oriented teams of <a href="https://wackerthun.ch/de/" target="blank">Wacker Thun</a> are analyzed, however through adjustment of `options.py`, any team playing under the <a href="https://www.handball.ch/de/matchcenter/" target="blank">Swiss Handball Federation</a> may be analyzed.
