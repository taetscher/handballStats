# handballStats
Just learning about web scraping - and about git in general

This repository allows you to scrape data from handball.ch.
It gets overall player statistics of pre-defined groups (corresponding to leagues/years).
Furthermore, the program gets statistics of each individual game (liveticker-stats) and plots (per stat available) multivariate time series of each team as well as time series data (progression over the season) of each player of each team.

Then, it currently calculates rudimentary statistics from that.
Like how many goals were scored per player per team per game on average.
I would like to expand on this in the future.

### Use the options.py file to navigate the output_png directory more swiftly!
In there you can see what number corresponds to which team - as the Swiss Handball Federation assigns each team a unique number per season.
