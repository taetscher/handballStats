# handballStats
Just learning about web scraping - and about git in general

This repository allows you to scrape data from handball.ch.
It gets player statistics of pre-defined groups (corresponding to leagues/years).

Then, it currently calculates rudimentary statistics from that.
Like how many goals were scored per player per team per game on average.
I would like to expand on this in the future.
